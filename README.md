# Programming for beginners üë®‚Äçüíª

_Draft mode_

The computer science is a really wide domain, but the focus for somebody new to it should be on only 2 things: to learn about algorithmic thinking and to learn about the different tools. By algorithmic thinking I am reffering to the ability to solve problems and, with the help of the tools, like programming languages, libraries and frameworks to create a solution for those problems. With this series of articles I will try to provide gentle introduction for people new to computer science and programming. My focus will be to use a programming language to explain algorithm design and to lay down a roadmap for things to evolve in the future in terms of learning.

The way I was introduced to computer science more than 10 years ago I find it very intimidating and very time consuming. I am very glad for learning computer science this way, but not all people have access to ... _To be continued_

## Brainstorm

- a friendly programming language: Python/JavaScript
  - why we need one?
  - what it does?
  - list of them and what they are good for
  - compiled vs interpreted
  - strongly typed
  - low level vs high level
- intro to algorithm design
  - example of problems: Knapsack, Schedule
  - solution space, define input and output
  - describe the solution in steps
  - implement the solution using a programming language
  - test the solution
